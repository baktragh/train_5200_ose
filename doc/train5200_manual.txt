Gameplay

You are a cargo train driver and
your mission is to load all cargo on
screen. For every piece of cargo
loaded, your train is elongated by
one carriage. You must not collide
with any obstacle or with your own
train. After loading of all items, a
gate that allows you to go to the
next screen is opened. The goal of
the game is to finish all screens
and maximize your score. The
difficulty of the screens increases.
In the later stages of the game, it
is recommended to plan a safe route
before starting your locomotive.

Lives and Scoring

You begin the game
with three lives. For every item
loaded, you get 10 points. After
finishing a screen, you will get 200
points for every remaining life. If
you lose a life, you lose 300
points. A new life is awarded for
every 5000 points. The game ends
after losing all lives. A new game
can be started from any screen that
has been reached already.
